# Testing Guide: AI Exercise Selection Fix

## 🚀 Deployment Steps
1. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin p2_imp
   ```

2. Deploy the Firebase function:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm run build
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm start
   ```

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Elbow Pain (Primary Fix)
**Input:** "I have elbow pain"

**Expected AI Behavior:**
- Should ask WHERE on the elbow (outside/inside/back)
- Should ask about activities (computer work, sports, repetitive tasks)
- Should probe for context (recent changes, new activities)
- Should take 3-5 exchanges to gather full context

**Expected Exercises (from Lower Arms category):**
- ✅ side wrist pull stretch
- ✅ band reverse wrist curl
- ✅ band wrist curl
- ✅ wrist circles
- ✅ modified push up to lower arms

**Should NOT include:**
- ❌ pelvic tilt (waist exercise)
- ❌ hyperextension (back exercise)
- ❌ Any leg/knee/hip exercises

### Test 2: Wrist Pain
**Input:** "My wrist hurts when typing"

**Expected Exercises:** Lower Arms exercises (same as above)

### Test 3: Bicep/Tricep Issues
**Input:** "My triceps are sore from working out"

**Expected Exercises (from Upper Arms category):**
- ✅ overhead triceps stretch
- ✅ triceps dips floor
- ✅ band side triceps extension
- ✅ close-grip push-up (on knees)

### Test 4: Neck Pain
**Input:** "My neck is stiff"

**Expected Exercises (from Neck category):**
- ✅ side push neck stretch
- ✅ neck side stretch
- Plus some upper back stretches

### Test 5: Knee Pain (Regression Test)
**Input:** "My knee hurts when I squat"

**Expected:** Should still work correctly with Upper Legs exercises

## 🔍 What We Fixed

### 1. Missing Exercise Categories
- **Before:** AI only knew about 6 body parts
- **After:** AI now knows all 10 body parts including:
  - Lower Arms (5 exercises)
  - Upper Arms (30 exercises)
  - Neck (2 exercises)

### 2. Body Region Mapping
- **Before:** No rules for which exercises match which complaints
- **After:** Strict mapping rules:
  ```
  Elbow pain → Lower Arms exercises ONLY
  Wrist pain → Lower Arms exercises ONLY
  Shoulder pain → Shoulders exercises ONLY
  etc.
  ```

### 3. AI Investigation Behavior
- **Before:** Generic questions ("Rate pain 1-10")
- **After:** Contextual, investigative questions
  - "Where exactly on your elbow..."
  - "Does your work involve repetitive gripping..."
  - Shows it's listening and connecting dots

### 4. Personalized Summaries
- **Before:** Generic summaries
- **After:** References specific details from conversation
  - Example: "Based on our conversation, it sounds like your elbow pain is likely tennis elbow from the combination of computer work and recently starting tennis..."

## 📊 Success Criteria

✅ **Pass if:**
- Elbow complaint → Lower Arms exercises
- AI asks 3-5 investigative questions
- Protocol summary references specific user details
- Exercise names match exactly from curated list
- GIFs display correctly (if available)

❌ **Fail if:**
- Elbow complaint → Back/waist exercises
- AI asks generic 1-10 pain questions only
- Protocol feels generic/one-size-fits-all
- Exercise names don't match database

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

If exercises are still wrong:
1. Check Firebase function logs for any errors
2. Verify the function deployed successfully
3. Check browser console for exercise matching logs
4. Look for "Exercise not found in database" errors

## 📝 Notes

- The GIF mismatch issue (wrong GIF for correct exercise) is a separate ExerciseDB API issue
- Focus on verifying the EXERCISE SELECTION is correct first
- GIF accuracy can be addressed in Phase 2 if needed
