```

**After:**
```
AI: "Where on your elbow, and what triggers it?"
```

### 2. **Added Microphone Button** üé§

**Features:**
- Visual feedback when recording (red mic icon)
- Placeholder text changes to "Listening..." when active
- Send button disabled during recording

**Platform Support:**

## üéØ What's Working

‚úÖ **Elbow complaints** now get correct exercises (lower arm exercises)
‚úÖ **AI is more concise** - no more repetitive rambling
‚úÖ **Microphone UI** is in place and looks good
‚úÖ **Voice recognition** works in web browser
‚úÖ **All body parts** now covered (added neck, arms, etc.)

## üìù Known Limitations

1. **Voice Recognition on Mobile:** Currently shows "Coming Soon" message
   - Can be implemented with react-native-voice or Expo Audio API
   - Avoided for now due to dependency conflicts

2. **GIF Accuracy:** Some ExerciseDB GIFs still don't match perfectly
   - This is an API issue, not our matching logic
   - Consider upgrading to Wibbi ($33/mo) for better videos

## üöÄ Next Steps (When Ready)

### **Option 1: Complete Voice Recognition**
- Integrate native voice recognition for iOS/Android
- Add voice feedback (audio confirmation)
- Add language selection

### **Option 2: Living Recovery Plans** (Your idea!)
- Make plan header a collapsible chat
- Allow users to refine exercises
- "This exercise hurts" ‚Üí AI suggests replacement
- Dynamic protocol updates

### **Option 3: Enhanced AI Memory**
- Remember user's injury history
- Track which exercises worked/didn't work
- Personalize future recommendations
