## 🚀 How to Use (Quick Start)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /home/kelly/Desktop/Recoverly/scripts
npm install
```

### Step 2: Test on Sample
```bash
npm run research:sample
```

This will:
- Research 10 random exercises
- Show detailed progress
- Generate CSV + JSON reports

### Step 3: Review Results
Open `youtube-research-results.csv` and look for:
- ✅ Score ≥ 70 = Excellent matches
- ⚠️  Score < 50 = May need manual review
- ⏱️  Duration: 30s-2min ideal

### Step 4: Run Full Research
```bash
npm run research
```

This will:
- Take ~20-30 minutes
- Research all 333 exercises
- Use ~1,500 API quota (you have 10,000/day)

### Step 5: Upload to Firestore (Optional)
```bash
# Preview first
npm run upload:dry

# Then upload (requires firebase-service-account.json)
npm run upload
```

## 🎓 Search Strategy Explained

The script tests **5 strategies in order** until finding a good match:

### Strategy 1: 30-Second Demo (Most Specific)
```
Query: "dead bug" 30 second demonstration physical therapy
Filters: short duration, HD, embeddable, English
Target: Ultra-short professional demos
```

### Strategy 2: 1-Minute Tutorial
```
Query: "dead bug" 1 minute how to physical therapy
Filters: short duration, embeddable, English
Target: Quick instructional videos
```

### Strategy 3: Quick Technique (Anti-Compilation)
```
Query: "dead bug" quick technique -routine -workout
Filters: short duration, HD, embeddable, English
Target: Single-exercise focus (excludes compilations)
```

### Strategy 4: Exact Phrase Demo
```
Query: "dead bug" physical therapy demonstration
Filters: short duration, embeddable, English
Target: Professional PT demonstrations
```

### Strategy 5: Basic Tutorial (Fallback)
```
Query: dead bug exercise tutorial
Filters: short duration, embeddable
Target: General exercise tutorials
```

**Key Innovation:** Using quotes around exercise name (e.g., `"dead bug"`) forces exact phrase matching, which eliminates multi-exercise compilation videos.

## 📊 Scoring System (How Videos Are Evaluated)

| Criteria | Points | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Exercise name in title** | 50 | Confirms video is about THIS specific exercise |
| **PT keywords** | 20 | "physical therapy", "PT", "physio" = professional content |
| **Tutorial keywords** | 10 | "how to", "tutorial", "demo" = instructional focus |
| **Duration 30-120s** | 30 | Perfect length for quick reference |
| **Duration 20-180s** | 20 | Good length |
| **Duration 10-240s** | 10 | Acceptable |
| **Professional channel** | 10 | Channel name has PT indicators |

**Maximum Score:** 100 points

**Quality Thresholds:**
- 80-100: Excellent (use immediately)
- 60-79: Good (minor issues)
- 40-59: Fair (review manually)
- 0-39: Poor (find alternative)

---

## 📈 Expected Results

Based on the search strategies and scoring system, you should see:

**Score Distribution:**
- Excellent (80-100): ~40-50% of exercises
- Good (60-79): ~25-35%
- Fair (40-59): ~15-20%
- Poor (0-39): ~5-10%

**Duration Distribution:**
- 30s-2min: ~60-70% (TARGET RANGE ⭐)
- Under 30s: ~10-15%
- 2-4min: ~15-20%
- Over 4min: <5%

**Issues to Expect:**
- 5-10 exercises may have no video found
- 20-30 exercises may need manual review (low score)
- 10-15 videos may be slightly too long (2-3 min)

## 💡 Recommended Workflow

### Phase 1: Research (Today)
1. ✅ Run sample test to verify setup
2. ✅ Run full research (leave it running)
3. ✅ Review CSV results

### Phase 2: Curation (This Week)
1. Sort CSV by score (ascending) to find problem videos
2. Manually review videos with score < 60
3. Mark approved videos in spreadsheet
4. Note any exercises that need alternative searches

### Phase 3: Deployment (Next Week)
1. Upload approved videos to Firestore
2. Test in app with real users
3. Monitor which videos users skip/like
4. Iterate on problematic exercises

### Phase 4: Maintenance (Ongoing)
1. Re-run research quarterly for new exercises
2. Update cache for exercises with poor user engagement
3. Consider manual curation for top 50 most-used exercises

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites & Setup

### Required:
- ✅ YouTube Data API key (you have this in `.env`)
- ✅ Node.js installed (for running scripts)
- ⚠️  Firebase service account key (only for Firestore upload)

### Firebase Service Account Setup:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings
2. Click "Service Accounts" tab
3. Click "Generate New Private Key"
4. Save as `firebase-service-account.json` in project root
5. **Keep this file secure** - it has admin access

## 📊 Cost & Quota Analysis

### YouTube API Quota:
- **Daily limit:** 10,000 quota units (free tier)
- **Per exercise cost:** ~101 units (search + video details)
- **333 exercises cost:** ~1,500 units (strategies may find match early)
- **Remaining quota:** ~8,500 for other uses

### Time Investment:
- **Sample test (10 exercises):** ~30 seconds
- **Full research (333 exercises):** ~20-30 minutes
- **Manual review:** 2-4 hours (one-time)
- **Firestore upload:** 5-10 minutes

### Return on Investment:
- **Manual approach:** ~8-10 hours to research 333 exercises
- **Automated approach:** ~30 minutes + 2-4 hours review = 2.5-4.5 hours
- **Time saved:** 4-6 hours
- **Consistency:** 100% (same scoring criteria for all)

1. **Cache Hit Rate** - % of exercises with videos in cache
   - Target: 95%+ (315+ exercises)

2. **Average Score** - Mean relevance score of cached videos
   - Target: 70+ (good quality)

3. **Duration Compliance** - % of videos 30s-2min
   - Target: 60%+ (ideal for quick reference)

4. **User Engagement** - % of users watching videos
   - Baseline: TBD (measure before/after)

5. **Video Completion Rate** - % of videos watched to end
   - Target: 70%+ (indicates relevance)

## 🚨 Important Notes

### API Key Security
- ✅ Never commit API keys to git
- ✅ Keep `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Rotate keys periodically

### Firestore Service Account
- ⚠️  Has admin access to your Firebase project
- ⚠️  Keep `firebase-service-account.json` secure
- ⚠️  Don't commit to version control
- ⚠️  Add to `.gitignore` immediately

### YouTube Terms of Service
- ✅ Cache videos for 24 hours (script follows this)
- ✅ Use embeddable videos only (script filters for this)
- ✅ Don't download videos (script only stores video IDs)

### Rate Limiting
- Scripts include automatic rate limiting (100-200ms delays)
- If you hit quota, wait until next day or enable billing
- Don't run multiple instances simultaneously

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "API key not found"
**Solution:** Check `.env` file has `EXPO_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key`

### Issue: "Exceeded quota"
**Solution:** Wait until next day or enable billing in Google Cloud Console

### Issue: "No videos found" for many exercises
**Solution:** Check your API key permissions - it needs YouTube Data API v3 enabled

### Issue: "All videos have low scores"
**Solution:** This is normal for some exercises with unusual names. Review manually.

### Issue: "Script is slow"
**Solution:** This is intentional (rate limiting). Don't reduce delays or you'll hit API limits.
